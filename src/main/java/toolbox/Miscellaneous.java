 /*   If you want to track the total number of attacks in a game between
 each player try using a static instance variable.
 Static instance variable are shared by all objects with the same name,
 so no matter how many players you make it is always possible to keep track of all attacks between them all.
 Java Static vs Instance?

    To keep track of how many attacks each player won and track the
        average damage each player gave per attack, just use object instance variables again.

public abstract class Player {

    private static int totalAttacks;
    private int attacksWon;
    private int damageGiven;
    private int health = 1000;
    private String playerName;
    private String playerWeapon;
    private String battleLocation;
    private String specialGift;
    private boolean isPain;

    You can then get rid of the trackAttacks method.
    Then replace it with the correct getters and setters methods with the correct logic.
